Please write/ copy-paste your structured abstract here (max 1200 characters). A structured abstract is one that includes an Introduction, a Materials and Methods/ Approach section, a Results/Findings section, and a Discussion/Conclusions section. Reviewers will consider whether the introduction outlines clear objectives or hypotheses/predictions and whether these are justified by the background; whether the methods are appropriate for meeting the objectives; whether there are (preliminary) findings that connect with the objectives; and whether the discussion/conclusions follow from the (preliminary) findings. We strongly encourage novel, empirical submissions or evidence syntheses, but theory/hypotheses contributions will also be considered.

Please list 3-8 keywords (at least one of which should be a discipline/sub-discipline; e.g., "human behavioural ecology") which will help us assign your submission to a session or theme. Please separate each keyword with a semicolon.

**Introduction:**
The transitions to low fertility in modern human society stimulated several theoretical explanations. Fertility decline is often seen as a trade-off between quantity and quality of children with an adaptive outcome of long-term descendant number or wealth accumulation. We take inspiration from Rogers 1990, which shows that positive relationship between wealth and fertility only exist in rich environment, and ask a further question: does increasing wealth class number generate fertility decline because of increasing reproduction costs over classes?

**Methods:**
We develop an agent-based model in which simulated agents inherit parental wealth and an allocation strategy (proportion investment in children) with some mutation. Agents allocate wealth between fertility and inheritance in 1) an ecological setting with density-dependent death and 2) a "cultural" one where different wealth classes experience different marginal costs to reproduction. Descendant wealth is determined by the combination of inheritance and a random income from the environment. As a feature of the model, parents divide bequests equally among children which leads to low fertility.

**Results:**
Preliminary results indicate that parents investing more of their wealth in fertility (in both settings) leave more descendants in the population over time, and this dynamic converges more quickly in the cultural setting. Also, when the number of class increases, upper-class parents give less birth than the middle class.

**Discussion:**
These results suggest that class structure in society and class-based living costs might be crucial in explaining the modern fertility decline.
