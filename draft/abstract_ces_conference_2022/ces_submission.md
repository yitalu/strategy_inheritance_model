Please write/ copy-paste your structured abstract here (max 1200 characters). A structured abstract is one that includes an Introduction, a Materials and Methods/ Approach section, a Results/Findings section, and a Discussion/Conclusions section. Reviewers will consider whether the introduction outlines clear objectives or hypotheses/predictions and whether these are justified by the background; whether the methods are appropriate for meeting the objectives; whether there are (preliminary) findings that connect with the objectives; and whether the discussion/conclusions follow from the (preliminary) findings. We strongly encourage novel, empirical submissions or evidence syntheses, but theory/hypotheses contributions will also be considered.

Please list 3-8 keywords (at least one of which should be a discipline/sub-discipline; e.g., "human behavioural ecology") which will help us assign your submission to a session or theme. Please separate each keyword with a semicolon.

**Introduction:**
Human fertility decline is often seen as a trade-off between quantity and quality of children with an adaptive outcome of long-term descendant number or wealth accumulation. Positive relationships between fertility and wealth only exist in rich environments (Rogers 1990). We ask further: does increasing wealth class number generate fertility decline because of class-based marginal costs to reproduction?

**Methods:**
We develop an agent-based model in which agents inherit parental wealth and an allocation strategy with some mutation. They allocate wealth between fertility and inheritance in 1) an ecological setting with density-dependent death and 2) a "cultural" one where different classes experience different costs to reproduction. Descendant wealth is determined by the combination of inheritance and a random environmental income.

**Results:**
Preliminary results show that parents investing more of their wealth in fertility leave more descendants over time, and this dynamic converges faster in the cultural setting. Also, when the class number increases, upper-class parents give less birth than the middle class.

**Discussion:**
These results suggest that class structure in society might be crucial in explaining the modern fertility decline.
