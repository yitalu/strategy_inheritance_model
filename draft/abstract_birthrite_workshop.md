**Title:**

Revisiting the Social Mobility Hypothesis of Human Reproduction

**Abstract:**

Rogers (1990) extended the Leslie matrix model to account for the tradeoff between fertility allocation and inheriting wealth --- under certain conditions, natural selection favors individuals who reduce fertilities and lift offsprings with concentrated resources to higher social/wealth classes. We tested this theory with a replicated model but did not find consistent patterns. In our replication, the optimization of reproductive strategy is largely affected by the environmental randomness. There is also no globally optimized strategy as produced by the algorithm even when the randomness is ruled out. Finally, the effects of preset parameters such as the upper bound of fertility, number of wealth classes, and different ways of dividing bequests need more explorations.
